/**
 * @dev Compute percentages safely without phantom overflows.
 *
 * Intermediate operations can overflow even when the result will always
 * fit into computed type. Developers usually
 * assume that overflows raise errors. `SafePct` restores this intuition by
 * reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
 *
 * Can be combined with {SafeMath} and {SignedSafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing
 * all math on `uint256` and `int256` and then downcasting.
